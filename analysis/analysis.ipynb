    "According to a poll from Investor's Edge, the direct investing division of CIBC, 79% of Canadians acknowledge that it is important to know how to invest their money (Gonzales 2024). However, only 48% of Canadians are investing their money annually (Gonzales 2024). A large proportion of those hesitant to invest (57%) stated a fear of losing money as the reason (Gonzales 2024). It’s important for banks to understand Canadians’ investment habits in order to better provide services to support Canadians investment decisions. Keeping this in mind, many banks offer a lower risk investment option called bank term deposits.\n",
    "\n",
    "A bank term deposit is a type of secure investment that allows individuals to deposit a lump sum amount of money for a fixed period of time (term). The period of time can range from short-term to long-term. The money is “locked in” for the duration of the term at an agreed upon interest rate. At the end of the term, the customer will recieve the initial deposit along with the additional accumulated interest. It’s important to note that term deposits are very low risk and the initial investment is protected (IslandSavings, n.d.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we aim to determine whether a machine learning model can predict if a customer will agree to open a term deposit, using data from a Portuguese banking institution. Answering this question will be valuable for the banking institution, as it will allow them to focus their calling campaign on customers that are more likely to agree to a term deposit. This targeted approach will save valuable time and resources, as fewer customers will need to be contacted in future campaigns based on the models predictions. Additionally, this analysis will also help the bank understand their customers investment preferences, enabling them to build stronger relationship with their client-base and offer investment options that align with customer needs."

    "The dataset used in this project is from a direct marketing campaign conducted via phone calls from a Portuguese banking institution. The dataset was created by S. Moro, P. Rita, and P. Cortez and collected between May 2008 and November 2010 (Moro, Rita, and Cortez, 2014). Our team sourced the data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository which can be accessed directly here. Each row in the dataset represents a bank client, with 17 features that capture aspects of the clients characteristics, as well as whether the client opened a term deposit or not. Some features are more specific to the individual (e.g. age, job, marital status and education level), while others pertain to their relationship with the bank, such as such as past interactions through previous campaigns, or the number of days since the last contact."

    "To prepare the dataset for analysis, we addressed missing values and removed irrelevant columns. Missing values in job and education were imputed with the mode, as their proportions were small, and mode imputation preserves their categorical nature. For contact, we visualized its relationship with the target variable (y) and found that contact method correlates with subscription rates. Based on this insight, missing values in contact were replaced with \"Unknown Contact\" to retain its predictive value. Columns like poutcome, which had excessive missing values (82%), were dropped to reduce noise, while duration was removed to prevent data leakage, as it directly correlates with the target variable. These cleaning decisions ensure a clean, consistent dataset, while preserving key patterns for predictive modeling."

    "The summary statistics provide an overview of the central tendencies, variability, and range of the numerical columns in the dataset. The age column, with a mean of 41 years and a standard deviation of 10.6, indicates a diverse range from 18 to 95 years. The balance column shows significant variability, with a wide range from -8019 to 102127 and a standard deviation over 3000, suggesting the presence of outliers. The day column, representing the last contact day, is evenly distributed across the month, while campaign has a median of 2 and a maximum of 63, showing that most clients were contacted only a few times. The pdays column has many entries with -1, likely indicating no prior contact, while previous has a low mean (0.58) but a maximum of 275, highlighting infrequent yet extreme cases. These statistics offer critical insights into the dataset’s distribution and help identify features that may need further preprocessing."
